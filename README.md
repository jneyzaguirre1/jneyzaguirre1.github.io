# About me

I'm a Robotics MS student at the University of Michigan. I have a background in Robotics and Electrical Engineering, and I am dedicated to creating innovative robotic solutions that can bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applications. I am currently working at ROAHM (Robotics and Optimization for the Analysis of Human Motion) Lab, advised by Professor Ram Vasudevan.
