# About me

I'm a Robotics MS student at the University of Michigan. I have a background in Robotics and Electrical Engineering, and I am dedicated to creating innovative robotic solutions that can bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applications. I am currently working at ROAHM (Robotics and Optimization for the Analysis of Human Motion) Lab, advised by Professor Ram Vasudevan.

## Work Projects

### Picker Robot New Gripper

<div style="display: flex; ">
    <img src="./assets/img/picker_gripper.png" alt="gripper" style="margin-right: 10px; width: 500px; height: auto;">
    <p>For our picker robot we needed a new version of the gripper capable of grasping a wide variety of products type: boxes, bags, cans, bottles, etc. So I worked with an industrial designer in a prototype of this gripper. Our design had two fingers, suction cups, permanent magnets, and a horseshoe like mount for two differen bottle cup sizes.
