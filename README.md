# About me

I'm a Robotics MS student at the University of Michigan. I have a background in Robotics and Electrical Engineering, and I am dedicated to creating innovative robotic solutions that can bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applications.

# Portfolio

### [Tactile Neural De-rendering](https://www.mmintlab.com/research/tactile-neural-derendering/) 
Reconstructing local 3D representation of an object from its tactile signature by leveraging generative models.

### [ROB 550 Robotics Systems Laboratory](https://github.com/jneyzaguirre1/MBot_forklift) 
Multidisciplinary laboratory course with exposures to sensing, reasoning, and acting for physically-embodied systems. The class is divided in two labs through the semester: Armlab and Botlab.

### [ROB 599 Deep Learning for robotic perception](https://github.com/jneyzaguirre1/dino_evaluation)
Deep Leaning class focused on robotics perception. This class' final project consist on reviewing, checking, and improving a recent paper, in my case "Emerging Properties in Self-Supervised Vision Transformers (DINO)".
