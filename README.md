# About me

I'm a Robotics MS student at the University of Michigan. I have a background in Robotics and Electrical Engineering, and I am dedicated to creating innovative robotic solutions that can bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applications. I am currently working at ROAHM (Robotics and Optimization for the Analysis of Human Motion) Lab, advised by Professor Ram Vasudevan.

    <p>While working at MMINT Lab from the University of Michigan, I submitted this work to ICRA 2025. In it we introduced Tactile Neural De-rendering, a novel approach that leverages a generative model to reconstruct a local 3D representation of an object based solely on its tactile signature.

## Class Projects at UMICH

### [ROB 550 Robotics Systems Laboratory](https://github.com/jneyzaguirre1/MBot_forklift)

<div style="display: flex; ">
    <img src="./assets/img/forklift.png" alt="MBOT with Forklift" style="margin-right: 10px; width: 200px; height: auto;">
    <p>Multidisciplinary laboratory class with exposures to sensing, reasoning, and acting for physically-embodied systems. The class is divided in two labs through the semester: Armlab and Botlab, where students face common robotics challenges of manipulators and mobile robots. One of the things I am very proud of is the forklift design I did for one of the Botlab tasks, only using one actuator, acrylic, and 3D printing, I was able to design a relatively small, and fast forklift.

### [ROB 599 Deep Learning for Robotic Perception](https://github.com/jneyzaguirre1/dino_evaluation)

<div style="display: flex; ">

    <p>Deep Leaning class focused on robotics perception. This class final project consist on reviewing, checking, and improving a recent paper, in my case "Emerging Properties in Self-Supervised Vision Transformers (DINO)". As a group we tried to improve the work done in this paper by using a weak supervision training strategy to help stabilize the framework's sensibility to hyperparamters.

## Work Projects

### Cumpa Mobile Robot

<div style="display: flex; ">
    <img src="./assets/img/cumpa.jpg" alt="cumpa" style="margin-right: 10px; width: 200px; height: auto;">
    <p>While working at the startup Oddness Technologies, I led the hardware development of a new indoor autonomous mobile robot for the company. The goal of being a versatile mobile base to offer to our clients, capable of carrying load, sensors, or anything that fits the customers needs. I designed the electronics (PCB), mechanical structure, and firmware, and also did the initial tests of this robot.

### Picker Robot New Gripper

<div style="display: flex; ">
    <img src="./assets/img/picker_gripper.png" alt="gripper" style="margin-right: 10px; width: 200px; height: auto;">
    <p>Oddness needed a new version of the picker robot's gripper, capable of grasping a wide variety of products types: boxes, bags, cans, bottles, etc. I worked with an industrial designer in a prototype of this gripper. Our design had two fingers, suction cups, permanent magnets, and a horseshoe like mount for two differen bottle cup sizes, making it a very versatile solution in a small form factor.

### Picker Robot

<div style="display: flex; ">
    <img src="./assets/img/picker.jpg" alt="picker" style="margin-right: 10px; width: 200px; height: auto;">
    <p> When I started working at Oddness, my first project was to manufacture the first version of the picker-robot: an autonomous mobile robot (AMR) with a five degrees-of-freedom arm on top. It was a very challenging experience with many design iterations, testing at grocery stores, etc.

### [RFID Sensor Tower for Warehouse Invetory Tracking](https://youtu.be/xM8xKJk1jqE?si=R4uxR6jV7XnJK5Au&t=24)

<div style="display: flex; ">
    <img src="./assets/img/sierrabot.jpg" alt="sierrabot" style="margin-right: 10px; width: 200px; height: auto;">
    <p>While working at Oddness Technologies, I was challenged to design a first working prototype of a RFID sensor tower for a warehouse inventory tracking system in less than a month. Using mostly off-the-shelf components, sheet metal, and some creativity I was able to design and manufacture the first working version of Sierrabot's sensor tower.
